# MASINT Sensor-Based Signature Profiling Lab

This lab shows you how to build a measurement and signature intelligence (MASINT) capability using simple sensors. MASINT is the collection and analysis of a target's intrinsic characteristics (vibration, acoustic, thermal, etc.) and is difficult to deceive.

You will:
- Plan the collection scope and identify target objects or activities.
- Assemble a sensor array (microphones, accelerometers or thermometers) and capture baseline signatures for each target.
- Pre-process the raw data by filtering, normalising and segmenting it.
- Extract features such as frequency spectra (FFT), RMS values or spectral centroid from each sample.
- Build a signature library and train a classifier to distinguish between targets.
- Test the system on unknown signals and refine your algorithms.
- Document methods, results and confidence levels.

All data in this lab is synthetic or comes from public sources. No sensitive or classified data is required.
